    <!-- # Guessing Game P2

## Create UI for your guessing game!

You have the base code for a guessing game, now: 
* Ask the player to guess a number in the browser. 
* The player should be able to input their guess in the browser. 
* Show the player if their guess was successful or not in the browser. The player should 
also see how many attempts they have left. 
* After three attempts, inform the player that they have either won (on the last attempt) 
or lost the game. 
* The player should be able to restart the game.
